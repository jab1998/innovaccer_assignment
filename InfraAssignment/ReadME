Assignment : Infrastructure Engineering
Language used : Python (ver 2.7.14) (**Some syntax errors may occur if executed with Python3 **)
Operating System used : Ubuntu/Linux

Running the file : Type the below command in the terminal (python followed by a space and then filename)
	
		python --filename--

Eg:- python task1.py


I have added 3 more tasks to the given 2 tasks specified in the assignment.
So there are a total of five tasks done as part of my assignment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task - 1 : (file name - task1.py)

Problem : Find the top 10 largest files in the system.

Solution : The program should scan all the Drives and folders like C:/User/* (Windows) and /home/* (Linux) recursively and then identify the top 10 files which have the largest size on the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task - 2 : (file name - task2.py)

Problem : To clean up the Desktop without manually doing that tedious task.

Solution : The tool should sort the files on Desktop on the basis of file extension and move them in separate folders in Documents folder. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task - 3 : (file name - task3.py)

Problem : Say I want to get the info of all the files greater than 100 MB or 500 MB. Its a very hectic task to do it manually.

Solution : Given a specific file size in MB, the tool lists out all the files in the system which are greater than the given input file size.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task - 4 : (file name - task4.py)

Problem : Not a new one but its always a tough job to find out a file in the whole system and in some cases where you remember only some part of the file name (say you remember only prefix of the file).

Solution : Given a file name or prefix, the program scans all the drives and folders recursively and retrieves the info of all the files matching with it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task - 5 : (file name - task5.py)

Problem : Compressing a folder or directory is always necessary to move it through mail or compress its size etc..

Solution : Given the path of directory, the program compresses the directory and creates the zip file.
